*Conducted by IEEMA (INDIAN ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION)*

There were around 1400 entries from all over the country, from which only 70 got selected. From Karnataka only 7 were selected, and from Mangalore among 18 engineering colleges only ours was selected.

Mangalore: Electric Vehicle Prototype Designed by Students from PACE

*Press Release*

Mangalore: In an attempt to study the inverted pendulum principle, four students from the Electronics and Communication Department of P A College of Engineering, have successfully designed a self-balancing personal vehicle. Such convenient yet expensive vehicles are commercially manufactured by Segway. But these students have designed one for a price of just Rs 30,000 which otherwise would have cost Rs 5,00,000.

The final year students, Karthik A, Ashraf K, Asif Muthafa Baig and Akshay Rao under the guidance of Dr. Aziz Musthafa (HOD Dept. of EC, PACE), started working on the project at a fast pace after their semester examinations in December as they had been selected to exhibit their project at Elecrama 2014, i.e. the 11th edition of IEEMA’s (Indian Electrical and Electronics Association) premier flagship event and the world’s largest exposition of electrical transmission and distribution equipment, organized from 8th to 12th January 2014 at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC). Among a staggering 1410 entries from around India, 74 teams were chosen to display their prototypes at the final event.

An Arduino UNO board and motors in the base of the device keep the vehicle upright when powered on with balancing enabled. A user commands the vehicle to go forward by shifting their weight forward on the platform and backward by shifting their weight backward. The vehicle detects, as it balances, the change in its center of mass, and first establishes and then maintains a corresponding speed, forward or backward. An accelerometer and a gyroscope detect the weight shift. To turn, the user tilts the handlebar, which is coupled to a potentiometer, in the desired direction.

The two-wheeled, self-balancing, battery-powered electric vehicle has been made affordable by eliminating all the redundant electronics i.e. instead of five inertial measurement units, which is an electronic device that measures and reports on a craft’s velocity orientation and gravitational forces, using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes, they used only one with an altered code. They made use of a wooden frame and used open source software for the coding and programming of the transporter, and this resulted in huge savings.
